# Clicky Game - Southpark Edition

## Overview

Clicky Game is a React memory game. Try and click on a different image each time and reach the highest possible score of 12!
Clicking on the same image during a game will reset the score.

### Instructions

1. The application will render different images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

2. The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
